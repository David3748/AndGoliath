Best Witchcraft is Geometry

To the magician’s mind—

His ordinary acts are feats

To thinking of mankind

1. 

I took my Power in my Hand—

And went against the World—

’Twas not so much as David—had—

But I—was twice as bold—

I aimed by Pebble—but Myself

Was all the one that fell—

Was it Goliath—was too large—

Or was myself—too small

1. 

Silence is all we dread.

There’s Ransom in a Voice—

But Silence is Infinity.

Himself have not a face.

7.

Paradise is that old mansion

Many owned before—

Occupied by each an instant

Then reversed the Door—

Bliss is frugal of her Leases

Adam taught her Thrift

Bankrupt once through his excesses

8.

To die—without the Dying

And live—without the Life

This is the hardest Miracle

Propounded to Belief.
