While sometimes I worry about anthropomorphising machines, I just as often worry about mechanizing people. Here's an incomplete list of place I see this happening. If you have more examples, email me.

- I try to learn similar to Reinforcement Learning
  - Basically there needs to be a tight feedback loop
  - Does taking lessons from machine learning and applying them to human learning make you less human?
- People write like ChatGPT
- We have self censorship on tiktok
  - i.e unalived, seggs, corn
